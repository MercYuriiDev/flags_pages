## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — semantic, multi‐page structure  
- **CSS3** — styling and layout:
  - `background-color` for flag colors  
  - `border-radius` to create circular shapes  
  - `position: relative` / `absolute` for precise placement  
  - fixed widths/heights to maintain correct proportions  
- **Google Fonts** — Comic Relief for headings

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Building complex visual compositions with pure CSS  
- Mastering CSS positioning and layering  
- Structuring clean, semantic HTML5 pages  
- Organizing a static site into multiple difficulty levels

## 🎯 Goal & Inspiration

Reinforce fundamental front‐end skills by recreating flag designs from scratch.  
Inspired by [Fussy Flags](http://lascarid.es/fussyflags/), all code is written from scratch to explore pure-CSS techniques.
